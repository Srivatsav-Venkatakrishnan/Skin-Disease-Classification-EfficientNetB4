# Skin Disease Classification-EfficientNetB4
This system is designed to accurately classify skin diseases by analyzing images of skin lesions. Leveraging the power of the EfficientNet-B4 model, this solution provides a highly accurate and efficient method for distinguishing between benign and malignant skin lesions, aiding in early diagnosis and treatment.

## Skin Disease Classification using EfficientNetB4

This repository contains the implementation of a skin disease classification system using the EfficientNet-B4 model. The system classifies images of skin lesions into two categories: benign and malignant, providing a powerful tool for assisting healthcare professionals in the diagnosis of skin conditions.
